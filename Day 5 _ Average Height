# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
  
# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
sum_of_all_heights = 0
number_of_values = 0

for height in  student_heights:
  sum_of_all_heights += height
  number_of_values += 1

Average = int(round(sum_of_all_heights / number_of_values,0))

print(f"total height = {sum_of_all_heights}")
print(f"number of students = {number_of_values}")
print(f"average height = {Average}")
