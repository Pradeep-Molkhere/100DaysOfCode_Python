# Instructions
# This is a difficult challenge. 💪

# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map:

# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a letter-number system.

# Example Input 1
# B1

# Example Output 1
# Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.
# ['⬜️', 'X', '️⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '️⬜️']
# ['⬜️️', '⬜️️', '⬜️️']


#--------------------------------------------------

line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input() # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this row 👇

first_digit = position[0].upper()
if first_digit == "A":
  location1 = 0
elif first_digit == "B":
  location1 = 1
else:
  location1 = 2

second_digit = position[1]
if second_digit == "1":
  location2 = 0
elif first_digit == "2":
  location2 = 1
else:
  location2 = 2

map[location2][location1] = "X"

# Write your code above this row 👆
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
