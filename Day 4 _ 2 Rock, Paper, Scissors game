## Rock Paper Scissors

# Instructions

# Make a rock, paper, scissors game. 

# Inside the `main.py` file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console. 

# Start the game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

# From there you will need to figure out: 
# * How you will store the user's input.
# * How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
# * How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
# * And also how you will give feedback to the player.
