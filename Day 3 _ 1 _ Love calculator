# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."

# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."

# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is *z*."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53
# Print: "Your score is 53."
# Example Input 1

# Brad Pitt
# Jennifer Aniston
# Example Output 2

# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 73.
